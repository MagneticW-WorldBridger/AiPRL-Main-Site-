# Tool Calling Testing Guide

## Pre-Test Checklist

### 1. Verify n8n Webhook is Running
Test the webhook manually:
```bash
curl -X POST https://drivedevelopment.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/84b59153-ebea-475d-ad72-9ce89dd164a8 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "message": "Schedule an appointment for Test User (email: test@example.com, phone: +1234567890) from Test Corp on tomorrow at 2 PM. Current time is 2025-10-24T14:00:00.000Z. Send confirmation email to test@example.com.",
    "id": "test_user_123"
  }'
```

Expected response: A confirmation message from n8n

### 2. Deploy or Run the API
```bash
cd api-webhook
npm start
```

## Monitoring During Tests

### Watch API Logs
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Watch API logs
cd api-webhook
npm start
```

### Watch n8n Execution Logs
Open n8n dashboard and monitor:
- Webhook executions
- Calendar API calls
- Gmail API calls
- Any errors

### Watch Frontend Console
Open browser DevTools and monitor:
- Network requests to `/api/webhook`
- Console logs for errors
- Response times

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ All 10 test scenarios pass  
‚úÖ No errors in API logs  
‚úÖ n8n executions successful  
‚úÖ Calendar events created correctly  
‚úÖ Confirmation emails sent  
‚úÖ AI responses are natural and helpful  
‚úÖ Conversation history maintained  
‚úÖ User identity preserved across sessions  

## Troubleshooting

### Tool not being called?
1. Check OpenAI logs - is tool_calls present in response?
2. Check system prompt - are instructions clear?
3. Check tool descriptions - are they accurate?

### n8n webhook not receiving calls?
1. Test webhook URL manually with curl
2. Check firewall/network settings
3. Verify webhook URL is correct in code

### Parameters missing in tool call?
1. Check conversation history in logs
2. Verify AI collected all information
3. Check tool parameter definitions

### AI asking for info already provided?
1. Check conversation history is being loaded
2. Verify system prompt emphasizes using history
3. Check if info was in different format

## Next Steps After Testing

1. ‚úÖ Verify all tests pass
2. üìù Document any issues found
3. üöÄ Deploy to production
4. üìä Monitor real user interactions
5. üîß Iterate based on user feedback

## Production Monitoring

Set up monitoring for:
- Tool call success rate
- n8n webhook response times
- Error rates
- User satisfaction
- Calendar API limits
- Email sending limits

## Support Contact

If issues arise:
- Check logs first: `[N8N WEBHOOK]`, `[TEXT CHAT]`, `[TOOL CALL]`
- Review this document
- Test manually with curl
- Contact n8n support if webhook issues
- Contact OpenAI support if AI behavior issues
